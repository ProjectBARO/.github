## About
Our team has chosen Goal 3, `Good Health and Well-being`, from the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. This choice is due to the nature of GDSC, where many people aspire to be developers, and hence, have experienced neck pain from using computers for extended periods.

Upon searching related keywords via Google Trends, we noticed that the interest in this problem has been increasing as the digital age progresses. Notably, the search volume for keywords such as `neck pain` and `how to fix posture` has been growing in tandem, which made us realize the urgent need for a solution to this problem.

Therefore, our team has set out to solve this issue for people who work sitting for long hours, especially digital workers. By providing them with systematic health management methods, we aim to alleviate the problem of neck pain and contribute to the improvement of their quality of life caused by it.
